Hello! My name is Rodrigo

FullStack Web Developer

Technology has always been one of my greatest passions. Being able to apply my problem solving skills in this field has made
me sure that this is exactly where I'm supposed to be! It's become my everyday obsession to learn new skills and apply them to 
improve and better my experience, and that of others through coding!

When not coding I enjoy playing basketball, riding my bike and/or motorcycle, hiking and camping.
